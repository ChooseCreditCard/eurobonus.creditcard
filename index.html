      Best Cards for Earning EuroBonus Points
    </a>
  </section>

  <section id="overview" class="section">
    <h2>1. What the EuroBonus Program Is</h2>
    <p>
      EuroBonus is SAS’s loyalty and rewards program. Members earn points on SAS and partner flights, as well as on everyday spending through partners and co-branded credit cards. Points can be redeemed for flights, upgrades and other travel-related rewards across the Star Alliance network.
    </p>
    <p>
      The program is structured around two main concepts:
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>EuroBonus points</strong> — the currency you earn and redeem for flights and other rewards.</li>
      <li><strong>Elite tiers</strong> — levels that unlock additional benefits such as priority services and extra baggage.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="earning" class="section">
    <h2>2. How EuroBonus Points Are Earned</h2>
    <p>You can earn EuroBonus points from multiple sources:</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Flights with SAS</strong> — points based on booking class, route and sometimes ticket price.</li>
      <li><strong>Star Alliance partners</strong> — flights on partner airlines credited to your EuroBonus account.</li>
      <li><strong>Co-branded credit cards</strong> — points on everyday purchases, often with higher earn rates on travel or specific categories.</li>
      <li><strong>Shopping &amp; partners</strong> — hotels, rental cars and other partners that award EuroBonus points.</li>
      <li><strong>Campaigns and bonuses</strong> — occasional promotions that give extra points on selected routes or partners.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The more you route your travel and spend through EuroBonus partners, the faster your balance grows.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>3. How Credit Cards Boost EuroBonus Earnings</h2>
    <p>
      Credit cards connected to EuroBonus let you earn points on expenses that have nothing to do with flying. Typical features include:
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Base earn rates</strong> on all card purchases, often expressed as points per unit of currency.</li>
      <li><strong>Bonus categories</strong> for travel, dining or online shopping.</li>
      <li><strong>Welcome bonuses</strong> when you reach a certain minimum spend in the first months.</li>
      <li><strong>Fast-track or status boosts</strong> that make it easier to reach higher EuroBonus tiers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you live in a SAS focus market or frequently connect through SAS hubs, one or two well-chosen EuroBonus cards can become the main engine behind your points balance.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="redeem" class="section">
    <h2>4. Redemption Categories in EuroBonus</h2>
    <p>EuroBonus points can be redeemed for:</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Award flights</strong> on SAS and Star Alliance partners, including both short-haul and long-haul routes.</li>
      <li><strong>Upgrades</strong> from economy to higher cabins on eligible flights.</li>
      <li><strong>Hotel stays and car rentals</strong> booked through EuroBonus partners.</li>
      <li><strong>Other rewards</strong> such as experiences or merchandise in selected markets.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Most members aim to use EuroBonus points for flights or upgrades, where the value per point can be significantly higher than for merchandise.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>5. Elite Status Tiers</h2>
    <p>
      EuroBonus has several elite levels, each with its own benefits. The exact names and requirements can change over time, but the common structure is:
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Member</strong> — entry level with basic earning and redemption.</li>
      <li><strong>Silver</strong> — typically includes priority check-in and some extra baggage benefits on SAS.</li>
      <li><strong>Gold</strong> — lounge access, more generous baggage and higher priority.</li>
      <li><strong>Diamond</strong> — the top published tier with the strongest set of perks and recognition.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Some co-branded cards help you reach or maintain these tiers faster by giving status points, segment credits or milestone bonuses.

    <h2>8. Best Cards for Earning EuroBonus Points</h2>
    <p class="small">
      The best EuroBonus strategy is usually a mix of flying with SAS and partners and putting as much everyday spend as possible on the right credit card. The ideal card depends on where you live, how much you spend and how often you travel.
