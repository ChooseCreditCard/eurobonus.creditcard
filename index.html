        <h1>How Loyalty Credit Cards Work — From Spend to Miles</h1>
        <p class="hero-lead">
          Loyalty-linked credit cards let your everyday spending earn points or miles in airline or hotel loyalty systems. This guide shows you how those rewards are generated, redeemed — and what to check before you pick one.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Loyalty or Frequent-Flyer Credit Card?</h2>
      <p>A loyalty credit card is tied to a rewards program — often an airline, hotel chain or travel alliance — so that spending converts to loyalty points instead of generic cashback or generic reward points. These points can then be redeemed for flights, hotel stays, upgrades or other travel-related perks.</p>
      <p>Unlike generic cashback cards, loyalty cards are designed for people who expect to travel — they aim to turn everyday purchases into travel currency over time, benefiting frequent flyers or regular travelers the most.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Earning Mechanics -->
    <section id="earning" class="section">
      <h2>How You Earn Miles or Points</h2>
      <p>Every purchase with the card typically earns a fixed rate of miles or points — sometimes with bonus multipliers on travel, dining or partner categories. Some cards offer accelerated earning during promotions or for specific spend categories.</p>
      <p>Because points are tied to a loyalty program, rather than to a generic card rewards pool, you often earn perks like elite-status credits, companion tickets or bonus points when you book flights or stays — especially if you frequently use the same airline or hotel chain.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Redeeming & Value -->
    <section id="redeem" class="section">
      <h2>Redeeming Points — What You Should Know</h2>
      <p>Points from loyalty cards typically redeem for flights, hotel nights, seat upgrades or partner services. Redemption value is rarely fixed — it depends on seat availability, seasonality and loyalty-program award charts. Often, using miles for premium class tickets or last-minute bookings gives the best value per point.</p>
      <p>However, loyalty redemptions come with trade-offs: blackout dates, limited availability, fees or carrier surcharges can reduce value. Also consider whether the combined cost (fees + taxes + surcharges) still makes miles-based redemption worthwhile compared with paying cash.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>When a Loyalty Card Makes Sense — and When It Doesn’t</h2>
      <p>If you travel frequently — especially with the same airline or hotel chain — and can accumulate enough points to redeem large tickets or stays, a loyalty card can offer outsized value. It’s especially useful if you often fly long-haul, business class or travel abroad where redemption value is high.</p>
      <p>But if you travel rarely, or mainly domestically, the accumulation may be too slow and the annual fees or surcharge trade-offs may outweigh the benefits. For occasional travelers, a flexible cashback or rewards card may deliver better value overall.</p>

      <p class="small">
        EuroBonus.Creditcard is part of <strong>The CreditCard Collection</strong> — a suite of informational minisites by ronarn AS, each focused on one aspect of credit-card usage. This page helps you understand how loyalty and frequent-flyer programs integrate with cards, and what to evaluate to see if it fits your travel and spending habits.
      </p>
      <p class="small">
        We do not issue cards or run loyalty programs ourselves. Our aim is to summarise public documentation and typical practices so you can critically evaluate offers before committing.
      </p>
      <p class="small">
        Nothing here is financial or travel advice. Loyalty programs, award charts and card offers change frequently — always check the issuer’s current conditions before applying.
